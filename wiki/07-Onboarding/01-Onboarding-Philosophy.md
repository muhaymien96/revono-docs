# Onboarding Philosophy

This document defines how onboarding is treated in Revono.

Onboarding is not a special mode.
Onboarding is not a sandbox.
Onboarding is not exempt from safety rules.

Onboarding exists to establish **understanding and trust** —
not to bypass correctness.

---

## Purpose of Onboarding

Onboarding exists to:
- Introduce system concepts
- Help users understand flows
- Reduce uncertainty
- Build confidence

Onboarding does not exist to:
- Auto-configure unsafe defaults
- Skip confirmation steps
- Execute actions implicitly
- Hide consequences

---

## Equal Rules from First Use

From the first interaction:
- Proposals are generated
- Impact Summaries are shown
- Confirmation is required
- Audit logs are written

There is no “training mode” that bypasses safety.

---

## Guided, Not Automated

Onboarding may:
- Guide users step-by-step
- Explain why confirmations exist
- Provide examples and previews
- Encourage review

Onboarding may not:
- Execute on behalf of the user
- Auto-confirm actions
- Perform irreversible steps silently

Guidance is allowed.
Automation is not.

---

## Safe Defaults

Onboarding defaults must:
- Be conservative
- Be reversible
- Avoid side effects
- Avoid assumptions

If a default could cause harm,
it must be explicitly confirmed.

---

## Transparency Over Convenience

Onboarding favors:
- Explicit explanations
- Visible consequences
- Slower but safer progress

Friction during onboarding is acceptable
if it prevents future harm.

---

## Trust Establishment

Trust is built by:
- Consistency
- Predictability
- Respect for authority boundaries

Onboarding sets expectations for how Revono behaves —
those expectations must remain true later.

---

## Summary

Onboarding in Revono teaches users how the system works
without ever violating how the system works.

Safety during onboarding is not optional.
