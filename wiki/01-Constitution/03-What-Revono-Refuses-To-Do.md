# What Revono Explicitly Refuses to Do

This document defines **deliberate non-goals**.

These refusals are not limitations.
They are **protective constraints** that preserve trust, safety, and correctness.

---

## Revono Refuses Autonomous Execution

Revono will never:
- Auto-send invoices
- Auto-charge customers
- Auto-deduct inventory
- Auto-issue refunds or credits
- Auto-schedule operational workflows

Every impactful action requires explicit human approval.

---

## Revono Refuses Silent Automation

Revono will never:
- Perform background financial actions
- Retry payments without approval
- Apply hidden adjustments
- Trigger side effects implicitly
- “Fix” data silently

Nothing happens without being shown and approved.

---

## Revono Refuses AI Authority

Reva will never:
- Act on behalf of a business
- Replace human judgment
- Execute decisions
- Override confirmation
- Escalate or intervene silently

Reva reasons.
Humans decide.
The system executes.

---

## Revono Refuses Ambiguous Commerce

Revono will never:
- Guess whether something is a product or service
- Infer fulfillment behavior
- Apply inventory rules globally
- Blur product and service logic

Ambiguity is resolved explicitly — or not at all.

---

## Revono Refuses UI-Driven Business Logic

Business correctness does not live in:
- Buttons
- Screens
- Click paths
- UX shortcuts
- Frontend conditionals

UI renders intent and consequences.
It does not define behavior.

---

## Revono Refuses “We’ll Fix It Later” Safety

Revono does not ship:
- Temporary auto-confirm paths
- “Just for demo” execution shortcuts
- Safety bypasses for speed or convenience

If it is unsafe today, it is unsafe in production.

---

## Revono Refuses Customer-Facing AI Autonomy

Revono will not:
- Let AI communicate with customers autonomously
- Let AI negotiate, promise, or commit on behalf of a tenant
- Let AI represent a business without oversight

Tenants remain fully accountable to their customers.

---

## Revono Refuses Hidden Complexity

Revono prefers:
- Explicit steps
- Visible consequences
- Predictable flows

Even when this appears slower.

---

## Final Statement

Revono does not try to replace business owners.

It protects them from:
- Fragile automation
- Hidden side effects
- Silent mistakes
- Overconfident AI

These refusals are why the system is trustworthy.
